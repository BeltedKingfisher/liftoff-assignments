## Submission Instructions

### Overview
This is an app where a user can browse yoga poses to build their own routine. The user will use built-in audio cues and be able to manipulate the time stamp for each pose. The user can then play the routine back for their workout. The app will include information, photos, and instructions for each pose.
### Features
Pose Directory: Users will have a pose bank from which to select yoga poses. These poses will have an audio description of the pose along with a customizable timer for each pose.
Routine Builder: Users will be able to drag and drop yoga poses from the pose bank to a routine builder that will collect and organize poses as the user is building the routine.
Modal: If a user clicks on a pose, a modal will appear with more information about the chosen pose along with the timer that can be adjusted. The user can add the pose to the routine from this modal or from dragging and dropping from the pose bank.
Routine Player: Once the routine is built, the app will be able to play back each pose with the given time stamp and audio description.
